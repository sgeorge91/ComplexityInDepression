# ComplexityInDepression

This repository gives the codes assocated with the paper "Complexity makes the difference : Uncovering complexity details in actigraphy patterns to differentiate the depressed from the non-depressed". 
The repository has one primary python code, which uses two seperate executables, rp and UD.out. 
The raw CPP file for rank ordering(UD.cpp) is supplied, and an executable can be generated for the same.
The executable rp is from the standalone software TOCSY, which can be found at https://tocsy.pik-postdam.de
